## 📝 Abstract
The study proposes a novel approach to the prediction of news sentiment using historical stock price data using machine learning techniques. Traditionally, financial prediction has relied on news sentiment analysis to predict stock price movements, based on the premise that external information drives market behavior. In contrast, this approach presumes that stock prices, which rapidly incorporate and reflect a broad range of market information and investor anticipation, could be effective predictors of news sentiment that will be evident in the future. The proposed method aims to identify whether market prices embody key information that is later evident in news reports. Theoretical implications and initial analysis show that the information contained in stock prices can provide key insights into the future news sentiment, challenging the use of traditional sentiment-based prediction models.

## 🎯 Objectives
Developing a machine learning model that will be capable of forecasting major news events from past stock price information, thus proving the forward-looking nature of the market and countering the need for news sentiment analysis to predict stock prices.

## 📖 Theoretical Framework
The stock price can be used to predict the news, which proves the efficient market hypothesis and questions the need to analyze the news along with market data, since market data already reflect what can be found in the news. This will reduce the reliance on news sentiment analysis. For consistency, the relative dates (e.g., “2d” or “5h” ago) in the news dataset were converted into absolute dates (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD). The news and stock datasets were then merged on the date field, enabling the alignment of news sentiment with specific stock price movements. Additional preprocessing included standardizing numerical features and engineering target variables. One target variable was derived from sentiment analysis (positive sentiment is labeled as 1 if it exceeds negative sentiment, otherwise 0), and another represented the stock price increase by comparing the closing price of consecutive trading days.
The VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model was employed to perform sentiment analysis on the news headlines. For each headline, sentiment scores for negative, neutral, and positive sentiments were computed. These scores were then appended to the merged dataset, forming the basis for predicting the influence of news sentiment on stock price movements.

## 🔬 Methodology
The news data was collected by scraping 200 pages of stock-related articles from Business Insider using Python libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to extract headlines and their relative publication dates. Simultaneously, historical stock data for Infosys (INFY) over a 10-year period with daily intervals was retrieved using the yfinance library, ensuring alignment between market events and corresponding news sentiment. For consistency, the relative dates (e.g., "2d" or "5h" ago) in the news dataset were converted into absolute dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, and the news and stock datasets were merged on the date field to align news sentiment with specific stock price movements. Additional preprocessing included standardizing numerical features and engineering target variables, with one target variable derived from sentiment analysis—labeling positive sentiment as 1 if it exceeded negative sentiment, otherwise 0—and another representing stock price increases by comparing consecutive closing prices. Sentiment analysis was performed using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, which computed negative, neutral, and positive sentiment scores for each headline; these scores were appended to the merged dataset to form the basis for predicting the influence of news sentiment on stock price movements.
